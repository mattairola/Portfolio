        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <p>
          I grew up in a small town called Angels Camp, which is tucked away in the foothills of California. My family has lived there for multiple generations and all have taken part in the family business of raising cattle. When I wasn't working on
          the ranch my time revolved around athletics and schoolwork. My main sports were basketball, cross country, and track and field. My persistence and work ethic paved the way to become a student-athlete in track and field and cross country at
          the University of Alabama.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I'm taking my persistence and work ethic into the web development field with my sights set on creating a meaningful career full of possibilities. Beyond the qualities listed above, I'm also a great teammate capable of adapting to
          dynamic roles and I possess a high passion for continuous learning and development.
