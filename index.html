        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <p>
        I grew up in a small town called Angels Camp, which is tucked away in the foothills of California. My family has lived there for multiple generations and all have taken part in the family business of raising cattle.  When I wasn't working on the ranch my time revolved around athletics and schoolwork. My main sports were basketball, cross country, and track and field. My persistence and work ethic paved the way to become a student-athlete in track and field and cross country at the University of Alabama.
        </p>
        <p>
        Following graduation, I began coaching and giving back to the sport that was able to give so much to me. Now I'm taking my persistence into the web development field. With my sights set on creating a meaningful career where the possibilities are endless.
